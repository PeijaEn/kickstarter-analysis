# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
  The goal was to help our friend with her fundraiser for her play, "Fever". To do so, I preformed Data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects. More specifically I looked into how different campaigns compared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. Using the Kickstarter database, I created visual figures for Outcomes based on the launch date and Outcomes based on their goals. Finally, I also added this written analysis of the results I found which are as follows.
  
## Analysis and Results
  First i looked at the Theater Outcomes Based on their launch date. To do so I created a pivot table that showed the month and the outcomes of the projects that laucnhed in them (their results). I found that during April - August, you have a higher chance of a successful fundraiser. Another interesting thing was that out of the 1369 total projects, 839 were successful. This is encouraging as it's a 61% success rate.
  Next I looked at the Outcomes of the fundraisers based off of their initial fundraising goal. I created a table that categorized the fundraisers by their goal (ie - Goal is $1000) and the outcome of their fundraiser. I found that the lower the goal, the higher your success rate was. Once the goal reached the 10000-14999, the outcome of the fundraisers sways in favor of failing. 
  
## Conclusion
  All in all, I found that the results of this analysis make sense. The lower the goal, the more likely it is to succeed and that during the April through August, your fundraiser is more likely to reach it's goal. One limitation that sticks out is the personal/empathetic aspect. In a fundraiser there is a pitch, an apeal from human to a human, one that numbers can't replace (as of April 2022). Someone might not care about their fundraiser and that makes it more likely to fail but how you would need to measure how the person feels about the fundraiser and how that impacts their fundraiser.
